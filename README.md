# connect-four-mutliprocessed-alphabetapruning
My first extensive Python project, made only 3 months after I learned to first code. Features a dynamic depth AlphaBeta pruning algorithm to beat human players in a console format. Features multiprocessing as to accelerate the completion of each move. Code was completed without usage of AI. Ocassional hiccups from improperly configured win-search algorithm, but errors occur in 1/100 games. 

Please run this file in a console terminal, IDLE will be too slow to run the game at full speed, and breaks the multiprocessing.
